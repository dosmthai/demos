# About dosmth.ai
dosmth.ai is a 10-sec adaptive browser RPA - a platform for building exceptionally smart and adaptive automations from plain text.

With our solution, you can automate a wide variety of web automation tasks. For example:
- talking to people,
- outreach,
- getting data from one place to another,
- account creation,
- doing web research,
- and so much more (see here: https://twitter.com/dosmth_ai/).

That's AutoGPT on steroids. And we want to empower you with its abilities. 

We want you to automate everything that comes to your mind and build your own products with our ML models.
- You can automate the processes inside your browser with our Chrome Extension.
- You can build your own apps with our API, requesting "do this task on this website with this data" and have the results returned to you in response, just as with OpenAI's text generation APIs.
- You can run our engine on your servers, provide your own white-label solution to your customers, and so on.
